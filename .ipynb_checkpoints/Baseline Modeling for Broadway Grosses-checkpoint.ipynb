    "\n",
    "**Baseline Modeling**\n",
    "In this section is an indepth Exploratory Data Analysis of Broadway weekly grosses, types of shows, and other important features that may influence whether a show will close or not.  SVM and Random Forest are used as baseline modeling techniques while addressing things like class imabalance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**ANN for Broadway Grosses**\n",
    "Using the Keras API an Artificial Neural Network is constructed to use sophisticated algorithms to determine if a Broadway show should close or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wicked Time Series Analysis**\n",
    "The core to this data is the passage of time and how much money the show is making.  It is essential to take an in depth look at time series, how it can influence our predictions, and its components like seasonality.  It is concluded with a prediction of how much money the Broadway show Wicked lost the first year of COVID-19."

This means if we have 30 features, random forests will only use a certain number of those features in each model, say five. Unfortunately, we have omitted 25 features that could be useful. But as stated, a random forest is a collection of decision trees. Thus, in each tree we can utilize five random features. If we use many trees in our forest, eventually many or all of our features will have been included. This inclusion of many features will help limit our error due to bias and error due to variance. If features weren’t chosen randomly, base trees in our forest could become highly correlated. This is because a few features could be particularly predictive and thus, the same features would be chosen in many of the base trees. If many of these trees included the same features we would not be combating error due to variance. With that said, random forests are a strong modeling technique and much more robust than a single decision tree. They aggregate many decision trees to limit overfitting as well as error due to bias and therefore yield useful results."
